# Trans-humeral prosthesis control in a reaching task with Reservoir Computing and LSTMs

### Abstract
Controlling a prosthetic upper limb requires the reconstruction of multiple distal articulations. In addition, the higher the level of amputation is, the more articulations need to be controlled and the less kinematic information is available in the remaining muscles. By exploiting a contextual information, the position and orientation of a target in a reaching task, we aim to reconstruct natural dynamics of the distal joints using recurrent neural networks. We compare the performances of two models, an Echo State Network (ESN) and an LSTM, on two conditions: training on one subject alone, and on 5-fold CV on 15 subjects. 
With an equivalent number of trainable parameters, the ESN models shows better performances than the LSTMs on the single-subject task. In contrast, LSTMs shows a better ability to generalize when trained on multiple subjects, outperforming the ESN: this is for quantitative results, when we consider the MSE for the measure of performance.
